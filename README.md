# AdaViewer

This application combines some elements from NAF with an Ada lexer and syntax highlighter. It can be used to display Ada source code (.ads and .adb). I started to build a QtCreator plugin for the Ada 2005 language and the GNAT toolchain as an alternative to GPS. I didn't find the time to continue. Maybe someone else wants to take care of it.
